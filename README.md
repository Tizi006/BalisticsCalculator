# Ballistic Calculator for 2D Shooting Games

## Overview
This is a simple application that provides an input window for calculating the required firing power and angle to hit a target in a 2D shooting game. 
Ballistic trajectory calculation is inspired by the code found in [Forrest Smith's repository](https://github.com/forrestthewoods/lib_fts/blob/master/code/fts_ballistic_trajectory.cs).

## Features
- Set shooter/target positions with two mouse clicks
- Calculate firing angles
- Gravity value is saved locally
- Hotkey to reset calculations

## Usage
1. Click twice to set shooter and target positions
2. Determine gravity experimentally by comparing calculations with the game
3. Use results to aim in your game
4. Press hotkey to reset
